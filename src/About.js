                        Lit Codes is founded by software developers passionate about both Open Source and providing good software services.

More oftentimes than not we see that OSS projects get abandoned after the initial success (typically because the main developer is burnt out or don't have time to work on the project anymore). This makes it harder for startups and other companies to trust OSS solution as long-term reliable tools.

Tools like React, Angular, and Flutter have proven to be adopted because of their reputable creators.

Lit Codes are secure, fast and reliable by design, and they will get the support and attention they deserve.

                        Lit Codes is a remote-first global company, in other words, we are everywhere.

Lit Coders chose the digital nomad lifestyle, or are parents who prefer to spend more time with their kids, or maybe people that prefer the comfort of their home rather than working in a noisy open-office environment.

If you have a place to stay, and you have a laptop connected to the internet, you can be a Lit Coder.
